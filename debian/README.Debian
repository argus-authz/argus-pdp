argus-pdp for Debian
--------------------

On Debian 6, the available bouncycastle library is too old (bcprov-java 1.44). The upstream
sources are patched to use bcprov 1.46 and embed it in the /var/lib/argus/pdp/lib directory.

On Debian, the system configuration are stored in /etc/default. The upstream source are patched
to rename the RHEL /etc/sysconfig directory to /etc/default.
